## Boltzman distribution
------------
By leokruglikov

# Description
The project was made back in 2020, in order to simulate an ideal gas, which is represented by a bunch of particles, that collide elastically. The aim was to simply prove the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution law from statistical physics. 

The distribution graph given in green represents the number of particles in a certain velocity range. The average velocity of particles is determined by the internal energy of this simple gas representation.
